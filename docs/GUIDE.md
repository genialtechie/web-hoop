# Implementation Guide

This document provides guidance on implementing the 3D Basketball Swipe Game with Three.js and Ammo.js.

## Setup & Initialization

### Project Setup

1. Create basic HTML structure with canvas element
2. Load Three.js and Ammo.js libraries
3. Initialize the 3D scene, camera, and renderer
4. Setup lighting and environment

### Physics World Setup

1. Initialize Ammo.js physics world
2. Configure gravity and simulation parameters
3. Create ground plane with collision detection

## Core Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Basic Scene

1. Create a main.js file to bootstrap the application
2. Setup a scene using Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
3. Configure a responsive canvas that fills the viewport
4. Add ambient and directional lighting to properly illuminate the scene
5. Create a simple environment (e.g., a floor plane with texture)
6. Setup a camera position that provides a good view of the play area
7. Implement a basic render loop using requestAnimationFrame
8. Add window resize handling to ensure the game is responsive

### Step 2: Initialize Physics

1. Load Ammo.js using the enable3d library
2. Create a physics world with appropriate gravity (9.8 m/sÂ² downward)
3. Configure physics simulation parameters (timestep, max substeps, etc.)
4. Setup collision detection groups and filters
5. Connect the physics world to the Three.js scene
6. Create a ground plane with physics properties
7. Implement a debug renderer to visualize physics bodies during development
8. Setup physics update function in the game loop

### Step 3: Create Game Objects

#### Basketball

1. Create a Ball class that manages both visual and physical properties
2. Model the basketball as a sphere with appropriate texture
3. Add physical properties: mass (0.6kg), restitution (0.8), friction
4. Position the ball at the starting point (bottom of screen)
5. Implement reset functionality to return the ball to starting position
6. Add methods to apply forces for shooting the ball

#### Hoop and Backboard

1. Create a Hoop class that handles the hoop and backboard assembly
2. Model the rim as a torus geometry with appropriate dimensions (45cm diameter)
3. Create a backboard with transparent material
4. Add physical properties to rim and backboard for realistic collisions
5. Position the hoop at regulation height (3.05m) with proper orientation
6. Create a net using either cloth simulation or static geometry
7. Setup collision detection for scoring (trigger volume inside the hoop)

### Step 4: Implement Swipe Controls

1. Create an InputManager class to handle user interactions
2. Implement touch/mouse event listeners (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
3. Track swipe vector by recording start and end positions
4. Calculate swipe velocity based on distance and duration
5. Convert swipe parameters into force vector to apply to the ball
6. Add visual feedback during aiming (optional power meter or trajectory prediction)
7. Implement different control schemes for mobile and desktop
8. Add debouncing to prevent accidental inputs

### Step 5: Implement Scoring System

1. Create a ScoreManager class to track game score
2. Implement collision detection between ball and hoop's trigger volume
3. Verify valid basket conditions (ball passing through rim from top to bottom)
4. Update score counter and trigger visual/audio feedback on successful shot
5. Reset ball after scoring or when out of bounds
6. Optionally implement streak bonuses or multipliers
7. Add scoring animation and sound effects

### Step 6: Game Loop and State Management

1. Create a GameManager class to control the overall game flow
2. Implement game states: IDLE, AIMING, SHOOTING, SCORED, RESET
3. Create a state machine to handle transitions between states
4. Setup the main game loop to update physics, controls, and rendering
5. Implement proper timing to ensure consistent gameplay across devices
6. Add game start/end conditions
7. Create a UI manager to update the interface based on game state
8. Implement pause/resume functionality

## Optimization Tips

1. Use object pooling for frequent objects
2. Implement level-of-detail systems for complex scenes
3. Optimize physics step rate for performance vs. accuracy
4. Use bounding volume hierarchies for collision detection
5. Implement frustum culling for objects outside camera view
