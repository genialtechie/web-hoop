# 3D Basketball Swipe Game

A lightweight 3D basketball game where players swipe up on a basketball to shoot it into a hoop, built with Three.js.

## Game Overview

This game simulates a simple basketball shooting experience. Players interact with a 3D basketball by swiping upward on their device to shoot the ball toward a hoop. The game uses realistic physics to simulate the ball's trajectory, bouncing, and interaction with the hoop and backboard.

## Core Features

- 3D rendering with Three.js
- Realistic ball physics using Ammo.js (Bullet physics)
- Swipe-to-shoot mechanics for mobile and desktop
- Score tracking
- Responsive design that works across devices
